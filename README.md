Cliptate is a native macOS application that compresses the most time-consuming steps in audio and video production into one continuous, fully local workflow. No cloud upload, no API keys, no waiting on network round trips — every model runs on your Mac.

---

## Features

### 🎙 Voice Dictation — Speak to Type

Real-time streaming speech-to-text that works like an input method. Invoke it from any context with a global keyboard shortcut and get editable text as you speak.

- Streaming transcription with minimal latency
- Automatic multi-speaker diarization and labeling
- Custom vocabulary dictionary for domain-specific accuracy
- Global keyboard shortcut to invoke or pause anywhere

### 📝 Offline Transcription

Batch-transcribe audio and video files entirely on-device. Supports multiple ASR engines (Parakeet, Qwen3, FireRed ASR) and Apple Silicon-optimized MLX inference for fast, accurate captions without sending audio to any server.

### ✂️ Smart Pause Trimming

VAD-powered silence detection automatically identifies and removes dead air across podcasts, interviews, and course recordings. Rough cuts arrive closer to delivery-ready with minimal manual scrubbing.

### 👥 Speaker Diarization

Automatically identify and label multiple speakers across a recording. Sortformer and Silero VAD models run on-device to produce structured, speaker-attributed transcripts for interviews, panels, and meetings.

### 🔊 TTS Voice Synthesis — Four Modes

| Mode | Description |
|---|---|
| **Preset** | Built-in multilingual voices, ready instantly |
| **Clone** | Upload reference audio to reproduce a speaker's timbre and cadence |
| **Emotion Control** | Steer emotion and speaking style on a named speaker via text prompts |
| **Voice Design** | Describe a voice in text to synthesize an entirely original persona |

All TTS inference runs on-device via MLX. No audio is sent to the cloud.

### 🌐 AI Correction & Translation

Context-aware transcript correction followed by on-device or Apple Translation-powered multilingual output. Produce subtitles and scripts in multiple languages without switching tools.

### ⭐ Highlight Detection

Automatically surface the strongest moments and key sentences from a recording and mark them on the timeline — so publishing edits move faster.

---

## Export Formats

Cliptate exports directly into the tools you already use:

| **VTT** | Web captions for browsers and streaming platforms |

Compatible with **Final Cut Pro**, **DaVinci Resolve**, and **Adobe Premiere Pro**.

---

## Privacy & Security

- **Zero cloud upload** — audio, video, and transcripts never leave your Mac
- **No API keys required** — all models ship with the app or download on first use
- **No network dependency** — works fully offline once models are cached
- Suitable for sensitive, confidential, and compliance-regulated content

---

## Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| **Platform** | macOS 14 Sonoma or later |
| **Architecture** | Apple Silicon (M1 and later) recommended |
| **Storage** | Varies by model selection (2–8 GB for full model set) |

- **[MLX Swift](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift)** — Apple Silicon-optimized ML framework for ASR and TTS inference
- **[AudioKit](https://github.com/AudioKit/AudioKit)** — Audio processing and waveform rendering
- **[mlx-audio-swift](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-audio-swift)** — VAD, ASR, and TTS model integration
- **Apple Translation** — On-device multilingual translation
- **KeyboardShortcuts** — Global shortcut management
- **RevenueCat** — Subscription and paywall management
- **SwiftAssRenderer** — ASS subtitle rendering

---

## Use Cases

**Podcasters & Interviewers** — Trim silence, generate captions, and flag publishable moments without leaving the app.

**Vloggers & Short-form Creators** — Smooth out talking-head recordings and keep focus on pacing instead of manual cuts.
